            <h3>We all need to eat to live, but how many of us live to eat?</h3>
            <p>
                According to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is increasing. The definition of obesity is as follows:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight">
                <p>Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> "Abnormal" fat accumulation is usally measured with Body Mass Index (BMI) for adults. A BMI over 25 is defined as overweight and a BMI over 30 is
                defined as obese. In 2016, 39% of adults worldwide were overweight and 13% were obese. WHO considers obesity an epidemic and calculated in 2017 that
                2.8 million people die every year due to being overweight or obese. Obesity is also considered an easily preventable epidemic by the WHO,
                as it in most cases can be prevented by a eating a healthy diet and doing physical exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this data analysis, health statistics from two different countries, France and the USA, will be compared in combination with nutritional facts
                about packaged foods sold in these countries. In the analysis we will investigate whether the nutritional information,
                for example high sugar content, can be said to contribute to the health statistics.
            </p>

            <h3>Health statistics</h3>
            <p>
                WHO has compiled several statistics regarding health and obesity for most countries in the world. 
                A subset of the statistics will be used in the analysis, and the chosen ones can be seen in Table 1.

            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>
               The dataset used to get nutritional facts about packaged foods in this analysis is the Open Food Facts database. The database is non-profit open
               database, which means anyone all over the world can use the data and contribute to the database. In the database, there exists 459371 products from 
               France and 175661 products from the USA, which we divided in to two datasets, one for each country. We also downsampled the France dataset as it is
               significantly larger than the USA dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                We worked with features regarding nutriments, such as energy per a 100g and sugars per a 100g, as well as product names and food categories. Names and
                food categories was used to categorize the data so we could compare nutritional values between the two countries with products in the same category.
                This was to make sure the comparisions would make sense: comparing the sugar content of a lollipop from the USA with the sugar content of a soup from
                France would not give a true 
            </p>
            <p>
                While the open nature of the database generates a lot of data, the contributions are, as of yet, not automatically checked. This generates a lot of
                missing values in the dataset, as well as errors and inconsistencies. Our process for cleaning the data was:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove all rows in which all columns had no values</li>
                <li>Remove all rows where no product name or product category was defined</li>
                <li>Set all nutriments to be a value between 0 and 100</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The last point was important because no nutriment can be more than a 100% of a product. Since each nutriment is defined per 100g, we set that the
                range should be between 0 and a 100. The only nutriment features we did not do this for was carbohydrates_100g and energy_100g, as they can be
                more than a 100 for a 100g.
